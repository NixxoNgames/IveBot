# IveBot

The bot that created the iPhone X. It's strictly private. You may run it locally,  but it's not a useful bot to others and tailored for a specific need.

**Requires Node.js 8.5.0 or higher.**

It's planned to have some nifty commands like /assistant which directly communicates with the Google Assistant gRPC API. You heard that, Google Assistant in a Discord bot.
