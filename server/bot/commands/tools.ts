IveBot is a Discord bot written with Eris and care.
Unlike most other dumb bots, IveBot was not written with discord.js and has 0% copied code.
Built with community feedback mainly, IveBot does a lot of random stuff and fun.
IveBot 3.0 is planned to be a port to Eris with multiple new features and a complete rewrite.
For information on what IveBot can do, type **/help** or **/halp**.
The source code can be found here: <https://github.com/retrixe/IveBot>
For noobs, this bot is licensed and protected by law. Copy code and I will sue you for a KitKat.`
